Designing User-centered Menu-driven Java Program for File Testing (Menu system for filtering, sorting, and merging)

  1. A user can choose (a) specific file(s), and the program will read data from a few external files (supporting either txt or csv format).
  2. I have used FIFA [https://data.world/datasets/fifa] to get the statistical data.  
  3. My program also include sorting method - that helps to sort data according to the option setected and the user is free to choose the filtering method.
  4. Also, a user can choose a menu option merging several sorted files into a single sorted file. moreover, program generate an output file as well. output is generated for the sorted and the merger files as well.
